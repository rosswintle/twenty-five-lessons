Actually, speaking at LoopConf has been excellent. Brian has been a really great host and organiser.

My main point here was that being employed is good, being freelance is good.

And despite the often-touted impression that freelancing is some kind of utopia,
switching between employment and freelancing is entirely possible.

You should do what suits you and your situation, and not be swayed by the shiny,
social-media view of any kind of career.

It can be beneficial to have a single-track career with a single focus.

But it can also be beneficial to switch languages, tools, frameworks, and entire career paths.

The source quote is: "Writing things down isn't just for remembering things. It's for forgetting them."

But is that right? Well... writing things down can help you remember things:

* [A (very academic) study](https://www.openread.academy/en/paper/reading?corpusId=503252214) into whether taking handwritten notes is better than taking digital notes for memory and recollection.
* [A (less academic) article from the New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2414241-writing-things-down-may-help-you-remember-information-more-than-typing/)

But my point is that holding things in your head is a bad idea.
