Are you really interested in this lesson?

Actually, speaking at LoopConf has been excellent. Brian has been a really great host and organiser.

And I'm really glad I get to share some of what I have learned with you. Thank you for being part of my audience.` },

My main point here was that being employed is good, being freelance is good.

And despite the often-touted impression that freelancing is some kind of utopia,
switching between employment and freelancing is entirely possible.

You should do what suits you and your situation, and not be swayed by the shiny,
social-media view of any kind of career.

It can be beneficial to have a single-track career with a single focus.

But it can also be beneficial to switch languages, tools, frameworks, and entire career paths.

* I talk about this a lot in my blog posts [10 things I learned about freelancing in 10 years](https://rosswintle.uk/2021/08/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1/), which I only just realised has a very similar title to this talk!
* The [Being Freelance](https://www.beingfreelance.com/) podcast has always been inspiring for those who want to get into freelancing.
* The books [The Staff Engineers Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/) and [Being Geek](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8473471-being-geek) have both been immensely helpful for my career.
* The book [Engineering Management for the the Rest of Us](https://www.engmanagement.dev/) and Julia Evans's [Help! I have a manager!](https://wizardzines.com/zines/manager/) are also great guides both for being a manager, and for understanding your manager's job.
